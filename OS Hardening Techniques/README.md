In this project, I was able to complete a security incident report to document an incident that took place at a company. I was provided a tcpdump traffic log and successfully worked to analyze the log to identify the network protocol, document the incident, and reommend a remediation for the brute force attack. This experience allowed me to learn how to read a tcpdump traffic log and work to successfully put together a security incident report on the incident.  

Note: My work is presented in the "Security incident report" document where my documentation is presented. In addition, the tcpdump traffic log is provided along with an instructional document that I used to read the traffic log.
