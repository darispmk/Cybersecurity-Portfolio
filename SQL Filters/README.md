Here is my showcased work with SQL Queries. In specific, I was able to learn the different filters that can be applied to extract desired information from databases and records. Other information I learned include filtering by date, time, location, and departments. Using operators such as "AND," "OR," and "NOT" also helped in applying multiple filters and specifying categories.  

For this project, I was tasked with a scenario of looking at an organization's login attempts. By applying various filters to the SQL queries, I was able to successfully retrieve the necessary information for the organization.
