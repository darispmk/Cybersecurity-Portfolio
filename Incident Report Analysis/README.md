This work showcases my ability to write a report on a security incident. In this case, I was presented with a scenario describing the events that took place when a multimedia company experienced a DDoS attack. I was also tasked wwith using the security event to create a plan to improve security for the company. Practicing the process of reporting a security event as well as suggesting ways to respond and recover as part of the security team allowed me to gain insight as to actions security teams take after security events.


Note: "The Incident Report Analysis" document contains my analysis with two additional documents posted (as well as linked at the top of this document) to explain more about the scenario description as well as the NIST CSF (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework) which helped guide me in my analysis.
