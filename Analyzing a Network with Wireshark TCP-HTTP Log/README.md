In this folder you can find my work with analyzing network attacks. I was tasked with the responsibility to use a packet sniffer to capture data packets which then were analyzed. The information from this was put into a cybersecurity incident report where I identified the type of attack and how the attack caused malfunction. Through this project, I was able to apply my knowledge of data packets and apply it to a real-life scenario. I learned how to properly read a Wireshark Log and communicate information about a security incident through a report.

Note: The "Cybersecurity incident report" includes my work analyzing the Wireshark TCP/HTTP Log to write a report. The "Analyze network attacks Activity" document gives more insight on the scenario that was presented to me. Along with this, the Wireshark TCP/HTTP log is attached to see the log I had to analyze. Finally, a instructional document sharing how to read a Wireshark TCP/HTTP log is attached which helped to guide me through the process of analyzing the log and writing about it.
