Through this research, I was able to understand the differences and similarities between two common network protocol analyzers; this included Wireshark and tcpdump. Being able to understand the differences and similarities helps me understand when you would use one or the other in specific scenarios. Learning about this important tool used to analyze network traffic is useful in the cybersecurity field and I look forward to being able to use it to capture packets, monitor threats, and troubleshoot issues.
