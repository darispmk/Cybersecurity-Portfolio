Lab 4 was a graeat avenue for me to learn about web security. In this lab, we worked with a mock banking website where we first used a brute-force password attack with Python and HTTP scripting. We used a file of common passwords to recover a password as well. In addition, I was able to build a phising site using Flask that mocked the real banking website. With this, we worked to capture user information while they were inputting it into the website, essentially implementing a phising attack with JavaScript to keylog. 

This lab was very interesting to me. I learned a lot of the applications of web security and the different ways malicious attackers use Python, HTTP, and JavaScript to get sensitive information and to implement phising attacks. In particular, using JavaScript-based keylogging to capture the credientials in real time while users typed them into the website was so intriguing to see. I did not realize that being able to log user input without a form submission was even possible so being able to learn and implement that was enlightening.
