For lab 3, we looked deeper into hashing and symmetric/asymmetric encryption. I was able to use sha256sum and verify signatures with RSA. During this lab, I experimented with key length and hashing proving the benefits of longer passwords as well as the security behind hashing. In addition to this, I used AES-CBC to decrypt files that were encrypted using that. Then finally, I implemented my own ransomware using RSA that encrypted .txt files with a random key (which was encrypted with the attacker's public key). 

This lab work highlighted a deeper look into hashing and digital signatures. It taught me a lot about ransomware and how it works in the real-world. I learned how this translate to a real-life scenario and why it works to only allow the attacker to view the files. I see how the files are hard to recover without the attack doing so.
