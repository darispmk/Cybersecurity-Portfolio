About the Lab Folders:
These lab folders contain my personal work for this course. Each lab was collaborated on with a lab partner whose information was taken off the lab reports for privacy reasons. Likewise, some information was not written up in the lab instructions files for this reason.

Take-aways:
Overall, this course has allowed me an opportunity to grow my knowledge in the Cybersecurity environment. I have developed my ability to use Linux commands through the terminal, password hacking, phishing, ransomware and malware. My curiousity with the terminal has been heightened. Specifically, I enjoyed looking at how website phising works by implementing a fake website that replicates the look of another. It was interesting to see how information from user input can be collected through using scripts. This was mainly covered in Lab 4 which was my favorite lab of this course!  

I look forward to continue applying the material and concepts I learned in this course in the future!

About the Course:
CSE 3140 is a Cybersecurity Lab offered at the University of Connecticut. As per the UConn course catalog, CSE 3140 is a "Introduction to the design of secure systems. Explores issues that arise in multiple design phases to understand the limitations of the platform and the source of opportunities for attackers. Each unit will explore a system, its design, its vulnerabilities and how to exploit them, culminating with the creation, implementation and deployment of counter-measures to eliminate the vulnerabilities and nullify the threat."
