About the Lab Folders:
These lab folders contain my personal work for this course. Each lab was collaborated on with a lab partner whose information was taken off the lab reports for privacy reasons. Likewise, some information was not written up in the lab instructions files for this reason.

Take-aways:
Overall, this course has allowed me an opportunity to grow my knowledge in the Cybersecurity environment. I have developed my ability to use Linux commands through the terminal, password hacking, phishing, ransomware and malware. My curiousity with the terminal has been heightened. Specifically, I enhoyed I look forward to continue learning throughout out the rest of this course and beyond.
