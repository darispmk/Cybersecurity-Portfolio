The Vulnerability Assessment Report I completed, looked at an e-commerce company that operated using a remote database server. Since this database was open to the public and was a serious vulnerability, I was able to complete a vulnerability assessment to share the potential risks for the company. This written report allowed me to practice risk assessment, share the approach to my assessment, and share remediation strategies for the company. 

Note: My work is listed in the "Vulnerability assesment report" document where my report is written. In addition the "Scenario Overview" document shares a more extensive explanation on the situation presented. Finally, the "NIST SP 800-30 Reference Sheet" was the guideline I used to be able to complete my assessment. This document shares how to assess risk, different threat sources, threat events, and the likelihood and severity of those events.
